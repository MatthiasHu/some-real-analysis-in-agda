Type checking hangs when the field c<d is filled and the compatibility
goal is split.
What might prevent hanging?

- mkCorrect  -- no
- hole as definition  -- yes
- explicit t t'  -- no
- convex-comb-mono-0  -- no
- where instead of let  -- no
- without compatibility  -- yes!!!
- mkCorrect and mkCompat  -- no
- unfolded compatible  -- no
- recursion operator  -- no
- type signature for split  -- no
- compatibility as funciton  -- no
- compatible and correct as functions  -- no
- both functions defined by a hole  -- no!
- filled in compatible
- no unsolved metas in import  -- no
- unspecified result type  -- no
- no use of from-yes
